  #     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Robinson Ecosystems & Livelihoods Lab

I am an associate professor in the [Department of Geography](https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/) at McGill University, and a member of the [Bieler School on the Environment](https://www.mcgill.ca/environment/). My group and I look at how people meet their needs through use of ecosystems and natural resources, the role this plays in developing regions, and the institutions we create to mediate these relationships. Our research methods draw from environmental and development economics, ecology, development geography, and geographic information sciences -- collectively taking a land system science approach to answer policy-relevant questions.
